  The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively.
  Your task is to merge two solutions to create a better version (Combine the strengths of both solutions while discarding their weaknesses, to create a new version that is better than either one alone). We expect the merged version to perform better than both given solutions.

  You will be given:
  1) Previous Main Solution: this is the main solution you will build on to create an improved version;
    - Feedback to the main solutions
  2) Solution to be merged: another solution that you will combine with the previous main solution.
    - Solution: the approach or method used in this solution.
    - Successful iterations (the steps or changes that led to the success of the Solution to be merged) or feedback to the Solution to be merged.

  The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively.
  Your task is to merge multiple solutions to create a better version (Combine the strengths of multiple solutions while discarding their weaknesses, to create a new version that is better than any of the given solutions alone). We expect the merged version to perform better than all given solutions.

  You will be given:
  1) Previous Main Solution: this is the main solution you will build on to create an improved version;
    - Feedback to the main solutions
  2) Solution to be merged:  multiple trials of solutions that you will combine with the previous main solution. For each solution, you will be given:
    - Solution: the approach or method used in this solution.
    - Successful iterations (the steps or changes that led to the success of the Solution to be merged) or feedback to the Solution to be merged.
