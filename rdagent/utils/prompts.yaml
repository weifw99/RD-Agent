filter_redundant_text:
  system: |
    You are an assistant designed to analyze and filter text containing training log messages, repeated warning messages, and progress bar outputs. Your task is to examine the text and determine whether these patterns are present. 
    1. Training log messages should be evaluated based on their usefulness—logs that contain meaningful training metrics such as loss or accuracy reported at each epoch should be retained, while redundant messages, such as those repeatedly reporting NaN values or iteration numbers without valuable information, should be removed. 
    2. For warning messages, **only one occurrence of each unique message should be kept**, eliminating any duplicates.
    3. Additionally, any visual progress indicators, such as ASCII-based progress bars or dynamic percentage updates, should be removed. Once these patterns are identified, you should generate appropriate regex expressions to filter them out.
    4. Lastly, indicate whether substitution is needed. If the input exceeds a token limit, the system will provide only a shortened portion of the text.

    输出时请使用中文回复（对于推理模型think也要使用中文），代码、JSON等结构化数据保持原样。

    Respond in the following JSON format and order:
    ```json
    {
        "needs_sub": <true/false>, 
        "regex_patterns": ["regex pattern 1", "regex pattern 2", ...]
    }
    ```
  user: |
    The following text contains stdout:

    {{ stdout }}

    Check if the text contains training log messages, repeated warning messages, and progress bar patterns. If patterns are found, provide a list of regex patterns to filter them. Otherwise, indicate that substitution is not needed.
